{:title "ðŸ“ˆ Playing with Vega-Lite pt-1" :layout :post :tags ["clj" "clojure" "vega-lite" "vega" "oz"]}

- I want to make data visualizations like the ones on [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful). I'm also obsessive about tracking personal metrics with a variety of apps. This is an initial attempt at exploring my own data, and Vega-Lite as a tool to visualize it. I decided to use [oz](https://github.com/metasoarous/oz) as a vega-lite wrapper because the setup was so easy.
- All of the source code can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/jgoodhcg/playground). 

- ## Calories and Macros
    - ### Starting data
        - The __csv__ export
            - The first data export I decided to visualize was my calorie tracker. I've been using [[fat secret]] for awhile because it __appeared__ to have a decent data export that included food item information. 
            - A few years ago I used [[Myfitnesspal]]. I found out after a year of tracking that it only had aggregate meal time macros in its export. I switched to [[fat secret for that reason]]. It turns out that [[fat secret]] has the data but it is difficult to parse. I've since moved on to [[cronometer]]. It's data export is a perfectly parsable csv. 
            - Example of an export __csv__ document:
                - Full day plus headers

            - Each level of specificity is nested below the next. You can see towards the top that there is a day heading with macro information for the whole day.
```javascript

"Tuesday, May 1, 2018",1523,46.06,20.721,122.24,6,71.9,69.23,3297,206,348
```
 Directly below that is a meal heading with aggregate information about the meal.
```
 Breakfast,250,4,1,26,0,22,26,1274,70,0
```
Directly below that is information on each meal item. Notice how the meal item is broken into two lines. The top line has the item with macro information, the bottom line has a measurement for the amount consumed. This measurement is not consistent in form.
```
  Trader Joe's Wild Salmon Jerky,160,4,1,4,0,2,26,1260,70,
"   2  x 1 oz, 56 g"
```
The measurement above shows `"`'s wrapping, an `x` to indicate quantity of measurement, and a comma with a standardized measurement after it. Another example of a meal item has none of those things.
```
  Wonka Nerd Rope,90,0,0,22,0,20,0,0,0,0
   1 rope
```
After the last meal item of Breakfast there will be the next meal heading for Lunch. The same happens for meal headings and days.


    - ### Transformation
        - When considering how to parse this I found two things that looked promising. The first was [from juxt](https://juxt.pro/blog/parsing-with-clojure-spec) and used [[clojure spec]]. The second was [[instaparse]] [link](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse). I went with spec. In hindsight I should have taken the time to learn instaparse. 
        - Making a spec for each type of heading.
            - Specs:
```clojure
(ns fat-secret
  (:require [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]))

(s/def ::day-heading
  (s/cat
    :day-of-week #{"\"Monday" "\"Tuesday" "\"Wednesday" "\"Thursday" "\"Friday" "\"Saturday" "\"Sunday"}
    :month-day #(re-matches #"^\s{1}(January|Febuary|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December){1}\s[0-9]{1,2}" %)
    :year #(re-matches #"^\s{1}[0-9]{4}\"" %)

    ;; should check on the order in the export sheet before trusting this
    :cals (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :fat (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :sat (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :carbs (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :fiber (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :sugar (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :prot (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :sod (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :chol (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :potassium (s/? blank-or-float?)
    ))

(s/def ::meal-heading
  (s/cat
    :meal #{" Breakfast" " Lunch" " Dinner" " Snacks/Other"}
    ;; should check on the order in the export sheet before trusting this
    :cals (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :fat (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :sat (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :carbs (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :fiber (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :sugar (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :prot (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :sod (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :chol (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :potassium (s/? blank-or-float?)))

(s/def ::item-heading
  (s/cat
    :description string?
    ;; should check on the order in the export sheet before trusting this
    :cals (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :fat (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :sat (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :carbs (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :fiber (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :sugar (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :prot (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :sod (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :chol (s/? blank-or-float?)
    :potassium (s/? blank-or-float?)))
```
            - These specs all use `s/cat` to take a collection of values and turn them into a keyed map. The `s/?` in each keyed predicate means that it matches zero or 1. In practice this means that when the spec finds a value for that key it moves on to the next key.

        - Getting the files ready for processing.
            - 
```clojure
(def files (->> "/absolute/path/to/files"
                (clojure.java.io/file)
                (file-seq)
                (filter #(.isFile %))
                (map #(-> %
                          (.toPath)
                          (.toString)))
                (filter #(str/includes? % "eml"))))```
            - This snippet iterates over everything in a directory, checking that it is a file, converting it's path to a string, and then looking for a specific file format. The result is a collection of absolute file paths as strings.
        - Turning the file paths into a piece of data to process
            - 
```clojure
(defn load-lines [file]
  (with-open [rdr (clojure.java.io/reader file)]
    (into [] (line-seq rdr))))

(def data
  (time (->> files
             (into [] (map load-lines))
             (flatten)
             (transform-lines))))```
            - This snippet takes the collection of file paths and maps over them with a reader that puts all of their lines into a collection. Those collections are loaded into another collection. The result is a nested collection of every line in all the files. `flatten` turns it into a single collection of every line in all the files.
        - Transforming the lines
            - 
```clojure
(defn transform-lines [lines]
  (->> lines
       (reduce
         (fn [data line]
           (let [item            (clojure.string/split line #",")
                 maybe-day-data  (->> item (s/conform ::day-heading) (zero-fill))
                 maybe-meal-data (->> item (s/conform ::meal-heading) (zero-fill))
                 maybe-item-data (->> item (s/conform ::item-heading) (zero-fill))]
```
            - Each spec uses `s/cat` which expects a collection of order sensitive values. Each line parsed is split by its `,` comma delimiter and passed into `s/conform`. What comes out of `s/conform` is a map of data. 
            - The lines are `reduce`-ed by a function that uses layered conditionals to figure out what the line is and then put it in the right spot of the reduced `data`.
                - 
```clojure
(reduce
         (fn [data line]
           (let [item            (clojure.string/split line #",")
                 maybe-day-data  (->> item (s/conform ::day-heading) (zero-fill))
                 maybe-meal-data (->> item (s/conform ::meal-heading) (zero-fill))
                 maybe-item-data (->> item (s/conform ::item-heading) (zero-fill))]

             ;; when it is a day
             (if (valid-conform? maybe-day-data)
               ...;; if it isn't a day, meal, meal-item, or meal-item-amount then it is we shouldn't do anything with it
                       (do
                         (println "Following line was not a day, meal, item, or amount")
                         (println item)
                         (println)
                         data))))))))
               ;; otherwise check if it's a meal
               (if (valid-conform? maybe-meal-data)
               ...

                 ;; if the line has fallen through this far then
                 ;; it's either an item or an item amount
                 ;; we can do some loose counting that should be write most of the time
                 (let [is-item-heading   (-> item
                                             (count)
                                             (> 2))
                       is-item-amount    (-> item
                                             (count)
                                             (<= 2))
                       prev-meal-keyword @last-meal-edited]

                   (if (and is-item-heading
                            (valid-conform? maybe-item-data))
                    ...
                     ;; when it is an item amount then add the :amount key to the last item from the last meal edited on the last day in the list
                     ;; there are some lines that might be misinterpreted by this loose conform
                     ;; those are all in the beginning of the document before a valid day
                     ;; data should be empty until a valid day is reached
                     ;; sp/transform won't add anything until all the levels above :items LAST are valid
                     (if is-item-amount
                     ...
                       ;; if it isn't a day, meal, meal-item, or meal-item-amount then it is we shouldn't do anything with it
                       (do
                         (println "Following line was not a day, meal, item, or amount")
                         (println item)
                         (println)
                         data))))))))```
                - `valid-conform?` is a function that checks the result from the `s/conform` call for an _invalid_ keyword.
                    - 
```clojure
(defn valid-conform? [x]
  (not= :clojure.spec.alpha/invalid x))``` 
            - One really ugly part of this is using an atom to remember context of the __last meal__.
                - 
```clojure
               ;; otherwise check if it's a meal
               (if (valid-conform? maybe-meal-data)
                 ;; when it is then build out the meal data and leave items empty
                 (let [meal-keyword (-> maybe-meal-data
                                        (:meal)
                                        (clojure.string/trim)
                                        (clojure.string/lower-case)
                                        (clojure.string/replace #"/" "-")
                                        (keyword))]

                   ;; some brittle state
                   ;; saves the the meal keyword, :breakfast :lunch ... , for the next line processing
                   ;; the next line will either be a meal item that should go into the saved meal or a new meal
                   (reset! last-meal-edited meal-keyword)
```
            - The `reset!` remembers the last found meal during parsing. That way when the next meal items are encountered it can update the right spot in the accumulating data object.
                - 
```clojure
                 ;; if the line has fallen through this far then
                 ;; it's either an item or an item amount
                 ;; we can do some loose counting that should be write most of the time
                 (let [is-item-heading   (-> item
                                             (count)
                                             (> 2))
                       is-item-amount    (-> item
                                             (count)
                                             (<= 2))
                       prev-meal-keyword @last-meal-edited]

                   (if (and is-item-heading
                            (valid-conform? maybe-item-data))
                     ;; when it is a meal-item then add it to the last day's last meal's :items list
                     ;; there are some lines that might be misinterpreted by this loose conform
                     ;; those are all in the beginning of the document before a valid day
                     ;; data should be empty until a valid day is reached
                     ;; sp/transform won't add anything until all the levels above :items are valid
                     (->> data
                          (sp/transform
                            [sp/LAST :meals prev-meal-keyword :items]
                            (fn [meal-items]
                              (conj meal-items maybe-item-data))))```
                - `sp/transform` is a [specter](https://github.com/redplanetlabs/specter) function that uses the path to update a piece of nested data. You can see the use of `prev-meal-keyword` from the atom to find the right meal to place the meal item under. The day is easy to know without any state from the atom because it is always the __last__ day.
    - ### Visualization
        - Visualizing with vega-lite is all declarative.
            - With `oz` all that is needed is to call `start-server!` and then `view!` with a map of data.
            - 
```clojure
(oz/start-server!)
...

(def calories-line-plot
  {:data  {:values data}
   :width 1500
   :layer [{:mark     {:type "boxplot" :extent "min-max"}
            :encoding {:x {:field    "date"
                           :type     "temporal"
                           :timeUnit "yearmonth"
                           :axis     {:labelExpr "[timeFormat(datum.value, '%b'), timeFormat(datum.value, '%m') == '01' ? timeFormat(datum.value, '%Y') : '']"}}
                       :y {:field "cals"
                           :scale {:zero false}
                           :type  "quantitative"}}}]})

(def macro-line-plot
  {:data   {:values data}
   :repeat {:layer ["prot" "fat" "carbs" "sugar"]}
   :spec   {:width    1500
            :mark     "line"
            :encoding {:x     {:field    "date"
                               :type     "temporal"
                               :timeUnit "yearmonth"
                               :axis     {:labelExpr "[timeFormat(datum.value, '%b'), timeFormat(datum.value, '%m') == '01' ? timeFormat(datum.value, '%Y') : '']"}}
                       :y     {:field {:repeat "layer" } :type "quantitative" :aggregate "mean"}
                       :color {:datum {:repeat "layer" :type "nominal"}}}}})

(def viz
  [:div
   [:h1 "Fat Secret Data"]
   [:div
    [:h3 "Calories"]
    [:vega-lite calories-line-plot]]
   [:div
    [:h3 "Macros"]
    [:vega-lite macro-line-plot]]])

;; Render the plot

            - The `calories-line-plot` uses a `:layer` keyword. This was redundant as there is only one layer.
            - The `macro-line-plot` uses a `:repeat` with `:layer` to create the same `:mark` and `:encoding` for four different values `["prot" "fat" "carbs" "sugar"]`. The `{:repeat "layer"}` in the `:encoding` can be read as a placeholder for each value to fill as it renders the layers.
