## Education

### B.S. in Computer Science, Grand Valley State University

## Favorite Tech

### Clojure(script)

Data driven, immutable, pure functions, and **simple**. Clojure has been enjoyable to use for these things:

-   Data visualization
-   Native app development
-   Backend web development
-   One off scripting tasks
-   Data manipulation for machine learning projects

### Containerized environments

Containerization and orchestration make managing production environments a better experience.

### Spacemacs

Realizing my life could run in Org Mode and Emacs.
