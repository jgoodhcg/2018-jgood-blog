## Favorite Tech

### Clojure(script)

Data driven, immutable, mostly pure functions, and **simple**. After [simple made easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) I was curious. Then after [the re-frame readme](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) I was hooked.

### Docker

Containerized environments are in. Reproducible, declarative, ephemeral is where its at. Containerization should be used from development to production. I've spent <span class="underline">alot</span> of time trying to make it work for development with mixed results.

### Spacemacs

Slowly realizing my life could run in org mode and emacs.
